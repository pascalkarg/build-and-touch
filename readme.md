# DIY VR Data Gloves 

![Build and Touch in Action](img/inAction.jpg)

## Overview
This repository provides an DIY approach to haptic feedback in virtual reality.
It is split into three components. 
- The tracking part, that is using Google's mediapipe for realtime detection of the users' fingers and hand position using an off-the-shelf webcam.
- The hardware part, that provides instruction to build the data gloves using a microcontroller and vibration actuators.
- A unity demo application.

## Work in Progress
This project is still in development and may undergo changes in the future.

## Instructions

Detailed instructions for each component can be found in the corresponding sub folders:
